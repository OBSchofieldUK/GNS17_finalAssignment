Guidance and Navigation Systems: E17
Final assignment Task 3:

Consider an arbitrary number Nof rotorcraft.
Design a relative-position-based algorithm that takes as inputs
  - Desired deployment,
  - Desired velocity for the center of masses (parallel to the ground)
  - Desired altitude.

Consider to include some rotorcraft that only can measure distances with respect to its neighbors, i.e.,||N(pi−pj)||, as well as the relative velocities Np ̇i−Np ̇j. Finally, consider the scenario where only one (leader) rotorcraft knows the desired velocityand wants the team to travel to different points in the space. An (overdetailed) report on formation control [6].
